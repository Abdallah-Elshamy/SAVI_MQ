# SAVI MQ

The project aims to provide [SAVI](https://www.savinetwork.ca/) with a Messaging broker as a service feature. This will facilitate the deployment of message brokers on [SAVI](https://www.savinetwork.ca/). The message broker will follow a standard API of an open-source broker engine ([RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) which makes it easy to port existing code to SAVI.
